# Violent-evens-in-Africa
This repository is for exploring the ACLED data that realted to all kinds to voilent data in Africa.

1. Data
My data were from a project called Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).
ACLED reported information of political violence events in over 60 developing countries an Africa and Asia from 1997 to the present. ACLED focuses on tracking a range of violent and non-violent actions by political agents, including governments, rebels, militias, communal groups, political parties, rioters, protesters and civilians.Data contain specific information on the date, location, group names, interaction type, event type, reported fatalities and contextual notes.

2.Variables of interest
Given the exact coordinates of each case, the location of the cases is my key variables. There are about 1360 cases observed around African unstable areas during only one month.

3.Research questions
The first question I want to do with the cases is to detect the clusters in all the areas.
The cases are not only described by location and year, but also by the type of violence involved in each event, the groups involved, and the type of conflict. We can detect clusters not only for general cases but also different kinds of violence events.
It helps us to keep eyes on area where there are a certain type of conflict, for example, events against civilians. And keeping track of them over time and try to predict it.

Here are two rough exploration images.
